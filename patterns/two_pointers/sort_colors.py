MEDIUM

Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 1 2]
Example 2:

Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]


SOLUTION
The best sorting algorithm isn't Dutch National Flag - because it goes through the array twice.
It is Count Sort, it goes through the array once.

For this problem, since we need to treat the numbers of the array as objects, we cannot use count sort
