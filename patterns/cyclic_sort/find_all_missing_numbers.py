EASY

We are given an unsorted array containing numbers taken from the range 1 to â€˜nâ€™.
The array can have duplicates, which means some numbers will be missing.
Find all those missing numbers.

Example 1:

Input: [2, 3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 5, 1]
Output: 4, 6, 7
Explanation: The array should have all numbers from 1 to 8, due to duplicates 4, 6, and 7 are missing.

Example 2:

Input: [2, 4, 1, 2]
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: [2, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 4

SOLUTION

    Check if current pointer [i]'s value is in correct index

Iterate through and count all missing numbers where number-1 != index
